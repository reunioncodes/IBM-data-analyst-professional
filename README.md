# IBM-data-analyst-professional

In this mini-course, I'll demonstrate foundational Python skills for data work. I'll complete a project as either a Data Scientist or Data Analyst, tackling real-world data to find patterns and trends. Tasks include data extraction, web scraping, visualization, and dashboard creation using Pandas, Beautiful Soup, and Jupyter Notebook
